Sync your secrets to Heroku when an environment variable is changed.

## Step 1

Navigate to the add-ons page. Click Heroku. Then click Connect Heroku.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='/assets/img/cloudinary/development-Dotenv_13_zmhxmk.png' />

## Step 2

You will be redirected to Heroku's website. Click Allow. This grants Dotenv access to sync config vars between Heroku and Dotenv.

That completes the steps to authorize Dotenv with Vercel.

## Step 3

The last step is to select an app from the drop down. Choose the app and click Finish Configuration.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='/assets/img/cloudinary/development-Dotenv_14_pwrnhc.png' />

That's it! Your secrets are now synced to Heroku and will continue to stay in sync when you modify your secrets.

Thanks for using Dotenv.
