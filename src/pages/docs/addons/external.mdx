# External Share

**Permit an external team or individual to access your project's environment variables.** Sometimes you need to share environment variables with an external team or contractor, but you don't want to add them to your organization. Use this add-on for such a scenario. External Team support takes just a click and then sharing the [infrastructure token](/docs/security/env-it). They will receive pull access only.

## Step 1

Navigate to the add-ons tab. Click External Share. Then click Add. Follow the prompts.

## Step 2

On the next page, you will receive a usage example. It is a curl command that looks something like this.

```shell
curl --fail -d "DOTENV_VAULT=vlt_bd9e11..&DOTENV_ME=it_b6a8bc.." -X POST https://vault.dotenv.org/pull.txt > .env
```

<ScreenshotBrowser url='/assets/img/cloudinary/Dotenv_3_cob0qz.png' />

## Step 3

Run the command in your terminal. It will securely fetch the environment variables and write them to a .env file on your machine.

That's it!
