# GitHub Auto-build

**Auto-build encrypted .env.vault file. Generate a PR on GitHub when an environment variable is changed.** It can become a chore to run `npx dotenv-vault build` each time you are ready to deploy new secret changes. Let GitHub do it for you with this automation add-on.

## Step 1

Navigate to the add-ons tab. Click GitHub. Then click Add and follow the prompts.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='/assets/img/cloudinary/development-Dotenv_3_omsmdq.png' />

## Step 2

You will be redirecedt to GitHub's website. Follow the OAuth flow.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='/assets/img/cloudinary/development-Dotenv_4_rcd5d9.png' />

That completes the steps to authorize Dotenv with GitHub.

## Step 3

The last step is to select the organization and repository. Choose your organization from the dropdown and enter the full the url of your GitHub repository.

Then set the base branch. In most cases, this is **master** or **main**.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='/assets/img/cloudinary/development-Dotenv_5_kwwspz.png' />

Once that is complete, you will receive a generated pull request on that repository. It will look something like this:


<ScreenshotBrowser url='/assets/img/cloudinary/Screen_Shot_2022-12-23_at_2.11.29_PM_gr1cwu.png' />

That's it!

Each time your team makes a change to an environment variable, GitHub will generate a pull request with the latest built .env.vault file.
