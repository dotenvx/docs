## Sending the invitation

Navigate to [your organization on Pro](https://pro.dotenvx.com) and click *Team* (left sidebar).

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7d282e2-9735-48d4-89aa-1657d78cd80f' www='pro.dotenvx.com' width='md:w-4/6' />

Click *Invite Member*.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ef57ec8-4211-4b20-a0ad-6577cbf62510' www='pro.dotenvx.com' width='md:w-4/6' />

Type their email address.

<Note>
  If they already have a Pro account, you will see their username autocomplete. If not, that's ok, enter their email address, and they will receive an invitation.
</Note>

Give them a role and click *Send invitation*.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/403036cb-b311-4583-be53-f55856da1f51' www='pro.dotenvx.com' width='md:w-4/6' />

Great! They are listed under invitations.

Next, tell your teammate to check their email.

## Accepting the invitation

Your teammate will receive an email invitation to join your organization.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96000d35-1939-421b-8b51-ba0a0a7c424f' www='apple mail' width='md:w-4/6' />

Clicking 'Join @organization', takes them to a login screen.

One final prompt let's them accept the invitation.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aca65fe2-3518-4c43-9398-a5e1e1caf845' www='pro.dotenvx.com' width='md:w-4/6' />

Just like that, they are a member! But notice *sync required*. 

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c75ffd8b-968b-4bc3-a3f2-8f669b092c8e' www='pro.dotenvx.com' width='md:w-4/6' />

Pro is zero-knowledge so there are a few more steps to do around public key exchange. Tell your new team member to run `dotenvx pro sync`.

<Note>
  **ðŸ’¡ Zero-Knowledge Encryption.** Zero-knowledge is great because even Pro can't know your secrets. But that necessarily requires an additional first-time step (or two) for you and your teammates. We've done our best to compress these steps into running a single command `dotenvx pro sync`.
</Note>

## Running sync

Your newly added teammate, sees *sync required* in the UI.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c38b119-569c-4b88-90e8-b3ce3cdbcc87' www='pro.dotenvx.com' width='md:w-4/6' />

Clicking *see more details* brings them to their account page with instructions to run `dotenvx pro sync`.

<ScreenshotBrowser url='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8046026b-f4f7-47eb-b863-fa7d42aa9af2' www='pro.dotenvx.com' width='md:w-4/6' />

### 1. Teammate

Your teammate runs `dotenvx pro sync` to generate their public key (used in later steps).

```bash
$ curl -sfS https://dotenvx.sh/pro | sh
$ dotenvx pro sync
âœ” [motdotenv] logged in
âœ” [motdotenv] encrypted
âœ– missing private key for organization [motdotla]. Ask your teammate to run [dotenvx pro sync] and then try again.
```

Under the hood, the cli generated a public/private keypair on the user's machine. The public key is additionally sent to the Pro service so that team members can use each other's public keys to encrypt and pass data securely without any third party (Pro) knowledge.

<Note>
  The private key NEVER leaves the user's machine and sits encrypted at rest. Pro's service NEVER has access to it. It is accessible solely by the cli during local decryption processes.
</Note>

### 2. You

You run `dotenvx pro sync`.

At this point, under the hood, the cli is fetches your teammate's public key, encrypts the org private key with it, and pushes the encrypted payload to the Pro service.

### 3. Teammate

Lastly, the team member can run `dotenvx pro sync` a final time to complete the syncing of their copy of organization private key.

```
$ dotenvx pro sync
âœ” [motdotenv] logged in
âœ” [motdotenv] encrypted
âš  [motdotenv] emergency kit recommended. Generate it with [dotenvx pro settings emergencykit --unmask].
âœ” [@motdotla] encrypted
âœ” [@motdotla] team (2)
âœ” [@motdotla] logged in
```

Essentially, you both went through a key exchange process by running `dotenvx pro sync` after each other. Cool!

Next let's sync a project.

## Bonus

The organization private key is an implementation detail that dotenvx pro obfuscates away for you, but you can optionally view it with `dotenvx pro settings orgprivatekey --unmask`.

```sh
$ dotenvx pro settings orgprivatekey --unmask
